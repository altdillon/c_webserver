# c_webserver 
This is a simple webserver/ framework that I wrote in C durring the 2020 CV-19 pandemic.  
I wrote it for three reasons.  
<b>
1. To do a project in C.  
2. To build a platform while totally not understanding what I was doing in order to have something to write memory exploits for in the future.  
3. Finally to have a simple C based web framework that I can use as a quick and dirty webserver for future projects running on a local network.  
</b>
Eventually I plan to write an actual make file.  I'm currently working on making this work as a deamon under linux.  I have no idea if this will compile under windows.
